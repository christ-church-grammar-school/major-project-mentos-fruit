        <b>Author notes:</b> This is a classic preparation in Vietnam, except usually we make it with squid. The baby octopus just looked really good at the market that time, so we thought - why not? With squid, you would slice it thin or score criss-cross on a 2x2'' piece of squid, to make it cook fast without getting chewy, and absorb the sauce. I took a chance with baby octopus and saute it really fast, and then cut it up when we eat. There is a slight chewy texture, but not in a bad way!! â€”<a href="https://food52.com/users/28643-matchaflan">matchaflan</a>

        <b>Directions:</b>  Separate the head from the tentacles if your fish guy hasn't done it yet.  Remove the eyes, teeth, cartilage spine and whatever else that is in the octopus head.  Rinse your octopus in running water for a minute.  DO NOT cut up the octopus now.  Cook first and slice it up later.
        <br/><br/> In a large saute pan, saute the onion until soft , then add the celery and saute for 5 minutes until soft but still a bit crunchy. Add the baby octopus and its marinade and stir quickly, saute only until just cooked (the meat will be pokeable with a chopstick, not transparent, not too soft).
        <br/><br/> Push the octopus to the outside rim of your pan where it's less hot, or you can even REMOVE the octopus from the pan. Add the tomatoes last for another 3-5 minutes until just cooked. If you have a really really large pan, you can put in the octopus and tomatoes together at the same time. Serve and enjoy!
