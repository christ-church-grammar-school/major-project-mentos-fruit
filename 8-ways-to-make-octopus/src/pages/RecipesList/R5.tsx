        <b>Cooking tips:</b> I think that the boiling window for your fresh octopus will be anywhere from 15 minutes to 5 minutes for an octopus of similar size to ours which was a bit over one foot long.  15 minutes is what was recommended by our fish vendor and will probably give you a well cooked but still tender octopus.  5 minutes is how long we actually cooked and this gave us octopus cooked more on the rare side: the outer layer cooked crunchy but sashimi soft for the inner bits.  It really depends on your preference!  Of course please adjust the cooking time if your octopus is smaller or larger.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Directions:</b>  Cut squid down centre to open out flat; score inside diagonally then slice thickly.
        <br/><br/> Heat half the oil in wok; stir-fry squid and octopus, in batches, until cooked. Remove from pan.
        <br/><br/> Heat remaining oil in wok; stir-fry chilli, garlic and half the onion until fragrant. Add capsicum; stir-fry until capsicum is tender.
        <br/><br/> Return seafood to wok with sauces, cooking wine, peas and sprouts; stir-fry until hot.
        <br/><br/> Serve stir-fry sprinkled with remaining onion.
